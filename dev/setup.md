# Setting up your system to compile Q OS

Since Q OS is primarily programmed in C on linux systems, it uses the popular <code>gcc</code> command to compile it. However, using the regular <code>gcc</code> command by itself will not work. To be able to compile Q OS properly, you will need a cross compiler specifically setup for Q OS.

## Fully Automatic Setup

If you want to get a cross compiler environment setup as fast as possible, you can enter this one command to set it up without worrying about changing any variables or code in the script. Note that by using this method you will have no customisation over how your cross compiler toolchain is setup and it is therefore not guaranteed to work on your system but it is a lot easier than following the Semi-Manual or, even worse, Fully Manual setup instructions. Just type this command into a new Terminal window running on Fedora 23 64 bit:

    sudo sh; cd $HOME; wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raphydaphy/Q-OS/rewrite/dev/setup.sh; sudo ./setup.sh;

This will ask you to enter your password. When prompted, enter the password for your Fedora user account, not the root account which can have a different password to yours whilst this is not always the case.

## Semi-Manual Setup
When I started to create a cross compiler toolchain specifically for compiling Q OS, I ended up spending more than fourty hours researching and compiling shell files to create the toolchain. Because of this, I decided to create a shell script that would automatically setup the correct developer environment for Q OS. You can find the script in the rewrite branch in [/dev/setup.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raphydaphy/Q-OS/rewrite/dev/setup.sh ). Download the script and open it in Fedora 23, 64 bit Workstation Edition. I recommend dual booting to run Fedora as it is a more stable experence for coding and developing but, although I haven't tested it, the script should work fine when running in a virtual machine.

Put the setup.sh script in your <code>/home/</code> directory in Fedora, in a sub folder called <code>src</code>. Make the directory by opening Terminal and entering the command <code>cd $HOME; sudo sh; mkdir src</code>. This will ensure that the <code>src</code> directory is owned by the <code>root</code> user on Fedora. If you accidently already created the folder as a non-root user, just enter terminal and enter the command <code>cd $HOME; sudo sh; chown root src;</code>. Next, open <code>setup.sh</code> in your favorite text editor, such as gedit or Kate (my favorite) and navigate to [line 7](https://github.com/raphydaphy/Q-OS/blob/rewrite/dev/setup.sh#L7). Change the home folder name from <code>$HOME</code> to whatever your username is in Fedora Linux. For example, if your username was <code>bob</code>, you would change it to <code>/home/bob</code>. You can check what is is by opening a new window in Terminal, entering <code>cd $HOME</code> then entering <code>cd ..</code>, and finally, <code>ls</code> and your home folder name will be displayed as one of the folders in the listing. 

Whilst you are looking at the shell file in your text editor, you can customise it to install or not install packages that you like or dont like, but only do this if you know what you are doing because writing the wrong commands can either force you to restart a process which is well over an hour long or even worse it could format your computers hard drive which results in your files being deleted.

Once you have completed all the above steps, open a new Terminal window, navigate to the directory you put the <code>setup.sh</code> script in, which if you followed this file exactly should be at <code>$HOME/src/setup.sh</code> and simply run the <code>setup.sh</code> script by entering <code>sudo ./setup.sh</code>. The <code>sudo</code> prefix is not technically required but it is safest to include it anyway since the <code>setup.sh</code> script takes over an hour to finish execution on an average speed computer.
