# Setting up your system to compile Q OS

Since Q OS is primarily programmed in C on linux systems, it uses the popular <code>gcc</code> command to compile it. However, using the regular <code>gcc</code> command by itself will not work. To be able to compile Q OS properly, you will need a cross compiler specifically setup for Q OS.

When I started to create a cross compiler toolchain specifically for compiling Q OS, I ended up spending more than fourty hours researching and compiling shell files to create the toolchain. Because of this, I decided to create a shell script that would automatically setup the correct developer environment for Q OS. You can find the script in the rewrite branch in /dev/setup.sh. Download the script and open it in Fedora 23, 64 bit Workstation Edition. I recommend dual booting to run Fedora as it is a more stable experence for coding and developing but, although I haven't tested it, the script should work fine when running in a virtual machine.

Put the setup.sh script in your <code>/home/</code> directory in Fedora, in a sub folder called <code>src</code>. Make the directory by opening Terminal and entering the command <code>cd; sudo sh; mkdir src</code>. This will ensure that the <code>src</code> directory is owned by the <code>root</code> user on Fedora. If you accidently already created the folder as a non-root user, just enter terminal and enter the command <code>cd; sudo sh; chown root src;</code>. Then open a Terminal window, navigate to the directory by typing <code>cd; cd src</code>, give yourself root access using <code>sudo sh</code> then simply execute the <code>setup.sh</code> script by entering <code>sudo ./setup.sh</code>. The <code>sudo</code> prefix is not technically required but it is safest to include it anyway since the <code>setup.sh</code> script takes over an hour to finish execution on an average speed computer.
