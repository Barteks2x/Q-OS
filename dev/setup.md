# Setting up your system to compile Q OS

Since Q OS is primarily programmed in C on linux systems, it uses the popular <code>gcc</code> command to compile it. However, using the regular <code>gcc</code> command by itself will not work. To be able to compile Q OS properly, you will need a cross compiler specifically setup for Q OS.

When I started to create a cross compiler toolchain specifically for compiling Q OS, I ended up spending more than fourty hours researching and compiling shell files to create the toolchain. Because of this, I decided to create a shell script that would automatically setup the correct developer environment for Q OS. You can find the script in the rewrite branch in [/dev/setup.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raphydaphy/Q-OS/rewrite/dev/setup.sh ). Download the script and open it in Fedora 23, 64 bit Workstation Edition. I recommend dual booting to run Fedora as it is a more stable experence for coding and developing but, although I haven't tested it, the script should work fine when running in a virtual machine.

Put the setup.sh script in your <code>/home/</code> directory in Fedora, in a sub folder called <code>src</code>. Make the directory by opening Terminal and entering the command <code>cd $HOME; sudo sh; mkdir src</code>. This will ensure that the <code>src</code> directory is owned by the <code>root</code> user on Fedora. If you accidently already created the folder as a non-root user, just enter terminal and enter the command <code>cd $HOME; sudo sh; chown root src;</code>. Next, open <code>setup.sh</code> in your favorite text editor, such as gedit or Kate (my favorite) and navigate to [line 7](https://github.com/raphydaphy/Q-OS/blob/rewrite/dev/setup.sh#L7). Change the home folder name from <code>raph</code> to whatever your username is in Fedora Linux. You can check what is is by opening a new window in Terminal, entering <code>cd $HOME</code> then entering <code>cd ..</code>, and finally, <code>ls</code> and your home folder name will be displayed as one of the folders in the listing.

Once you have completed all the above steps, open a new Terminal window, navigate to the directory you put the <code>setup.sh</code> script in, which if you followed this file exactly should be at <code>$HOME/src/setup.sh</code> and simply run the <code>setup.sh</code> script by entering <code>sudo ./setup.sh</code>. The <code>sudo</code> prefix is not technically required but it is safest to include it anyway since the <code>setup.sh</code> script takes over an hour to finish execution on an average speed computer.
