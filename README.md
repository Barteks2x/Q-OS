# Q-OS Rewrite Project


When I started working on Q OS, it was the first time I had attempted to code an operating system from scratch. Because of this, there are a lot of beginner mistakes in the code that could later lead to problems and bugs. In this branch of Q OS, I will be starting from scratch making a new kernel and bootloader. Once Q OS Alpha (this branch) is able to do everything that Q OS Pre Alpha (master branch) is currently able to do, it will be merged into the master branch.


Forking this branch is unrecommended and if you want to work on Q OS, it is best at the moment to do so in the master branch. For this branch, I will rewrite the Q OS Documentation and for now leave the version in the master branch unfinished. Documentation for Q OS Alpha will be a lot clearer and therefore also a lot longer, but it will make programming for Q OS a lot easier because every function and code file will be described in detail as well as resources for learning to code in C/Assembly and other languages that are used in Q OS.


## Q OS Alpha Features


Whilst this branch of Q OS will, for the most part, have the same features as planned for the master branch, it will also feature a either a FAT32 or COFF filesystem and a working bootloader before it is merged with the master branch. Because of all these features, it will take probably around two months to have the code in this branch ready for merging.
